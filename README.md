# TCS iON-Style Assessment Platform

A comprehensive assessment platform that provides secure test delivery, proctoring capabilities, and robust assessment management.

## Project Overview

This project implements a scalable and feature-rich assessment platform inspired by TCS iON. The platform provides:

- Secure test creation, management and delivery
- Proctoring with AI-based anomaly detection
- User and organization management
- Comprehensive analytics and reporting

## Project Roadmap

### Initial Setup

- Development Environment Configuration
  - Node.js/Python backend
  - React.js frontend with TailwindCSS
  - Docker containerization
  - CI/CD pipeline

- Core Services Infrastructure
  - API Gateway
  - Database layer (PostgreSQL + MongoDB)
  - Redis for caching
  - Message queue system (Kafka/RabbitMQ)

### Phase 1 Implementation

- Authentication & User Management
- Basic Assessment Engine
- Minimal Proctoring Capabilities

## Getting Started
